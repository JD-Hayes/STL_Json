# STL_Json
An introduction program for students in CSC 211 to use STL in C++

<b>Objective:</b>

Develop a JSON Data Analyzer using STL in C++. Students will work with large JSON files containing structured data such as user information, financial records, or weather statistics.

Requirements:

Use STL containers (vector, map, unordered_map) to store and manage data.

Use STL algorithms (sort, find, accumulate) to process and analyze data.

Parse JSON data from a file and extract meaningful insights (e.g., average age of users, most common category, etc.).

Use iterators to traverse and manipulate the data.

Ensure efficiency in lookups and operations by choosing appropriate STL containers.

Deliverables:

C++ source code with STL implementation.

Documentation explaining STL usage.

Sample output showing data analysis results.

Evaluation Criteria:

✅ Correctness of STL implementation.
✅ Efficient usage of STL containers and algorithms.
✅ Code clarity and documentation.
✅ Accuracy of JSON data processing.
