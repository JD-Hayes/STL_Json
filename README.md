# STL_Json
An introduction program for students in CSC 211 to use STL in C++

<b>Objective:</b>

Develop a JSON Data Analyzer using STL in C++. Each student will create a JSON file that contains at least 5 objects of different names and ages.

From the requirements below, use iostream to ask users for input on what they want to do. 

Requirements:

Use STL containers (vector, map, unordered_map) to store and manage data.

Use STL algorithms (sort, find, accumulate) to process and analyze data.

Parse 1 column of JSON data from your file by finding the average age of users.

Use iterators to traverse and manipulate the data.

**Bonus**Ensure efficiency in lookups and operations by choosing appropriate STL containers.

<b>Deliverables:</b>
C++ source code with STL implementation.

Documentation explaining STL usage specific to your program.

Sample output showing data analysis results.

Evaluation Criteria:

 Correctness of STL implementation.
 Efficient usage of STL containers and algorithms.
 Code clarity and documentation.
 Accuracy of JSON data processing.
